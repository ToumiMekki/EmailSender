Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to be applying for the Sales position at TradeLot. It's clear that you're looking for an experienced sales professional who can expand TradeLot's reach in the legal and financial services industries. With my proven track record of both sales and sales training success, I am thrilled at the opportunity to help make this growth strategy a success.

During my previous role at Retail Ocean, I was tasked with leading the company's new initiative for entering key industry verticals. I developed a new communication program that encouraged collaboration among multiple departments, which resulted in a 15% lead time reduction. I earned multiple awards for achieving leading sales numbers and was consistently in the top 5% of Retail Ocean sales representatives nationwide. I'm proud to be a four-time winner of the President's Club Award and the 2017 Account Opener of the Year award for generating more than $18 million in new client accounts.

With more than seven years' experience in B2B sales, I have developed a strong repertoire of successful sales techniques, but I understand the need to remain adaptable in today's rapidly changing economy. I am strongly committed to expanding my skills and delivering consistently reliable - and remarkable - results.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to learning more details about the Sales position and about TradeLot. Growth is essential to my continued success, and I'm excited for the chance to be a part of TradeLot's industry-leading team. My proven track record and TradeLot's quality products are a winning combination for increasing the company's market share.

Sincerely,

Toumi Ammar Mekki
